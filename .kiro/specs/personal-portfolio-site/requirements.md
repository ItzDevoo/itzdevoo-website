# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a professional personal website website that showcases personal information in a polished, smooth interface. The site will be containerized using Docker and deployed locally while being accessible publicly through Cloudflare tunnels and the itzdevoo.com domain. The project will include a GitHub repository with multiple branches for different environments (development, live, etc.).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the website, I want to see a professional and polished website interface, so that I can quickly understand who the site owner is and their professional background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a clean, professional homepage with smooth animations and transitions
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL present personal information in an organized, visually appealing layout
3. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, responsive feedback and transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the site owner, I want the website to be containerized with Docker, so that I can run it consistently in any environment and easily manage deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL create a Docker container that includes all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN the Docker container is started THEN the system SHALL serve the website on a specified port
3. WHEN the container is deployed THEN the system SHALL run reliably without external dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the site owner, I want the website to be accessible through my itzdevoo.com domain via Cloudflare tunnel, so that visitors can access my locally-hosted site from anywhere on the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to itzdevoo.com THEN the system SHALL route the request through Cloudflare tunnel to the local Docker container
2. WHEN the tunnel is configured THEN the system SHALL maintain secure HTTPS connections
3. WHEN the site is accessed publicly THEN the system SHALL respond with the same content as when accessed locally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As the site owner, I want a GitHub repository with multiple branches for different environments, so that I can manage development and production versions separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is created THEN the system SHALL include separate branches for development and live environments
2. WHEN code is pushed to different branches THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between development and production code
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL allow easy switching between different environment configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see basic personal information displayed clearly, so that I can learn about the site owner's background and skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display essential personal information (name, title, brief bio)
2. WHEN the content loads THEN the system SHALL present information in a scannable, well-organized format
3. WHEN viewing the site THEN the system SHALL display content that adapts dynamically to the viewing context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile visitor, I want the website to look and function just as polished on my mobile device as it does on desktop, so that I have an optimal viewing experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a fully responsive layout that adapts to the screen size
2. WHEN interacting with elements on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate sizing and spacing
3. WHEN the layout adjusts for mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain the same level of polish and professionalism as the desktop version
4. WHEN content is displayed on any screen size THEN the system SHALL ensure all elements remain accessible and visually appealing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As the site owner, I want the project to follow all industry best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable, secure, performant, and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is written THEN the system SHALL follow web development best practices including semantic HTML, clean CSS architecture, and optimized JavaScript
2. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL implement security best practices including proper headers, input validation, and secure configurations
3. WHEN the site loads THEN the system SHALL achieve optimal performance scores including fast loading times, optimized assets, and efficient resource usage
4. WHEN the code is structured THEN the system SHALL follow clean code principles with proper organization, documentation, and version control practices
5. WHEN accessibility is evaluated THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG guidelines for inclusive design and screen reader compatibility
6. WHEN the Docker container is configured THEN the system SHALL follow containerization best practices including minimal image size, proper security settings, and efficient resource usage
